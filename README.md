## Security Flow
* On Successful validation of login credentials, a JWT will be returned representing the user **(decode the below sample JWT on jwt.io for reference)**

```

```
* The received JWT should be included in the headers when calling a protected API
* Authentication Bearer format to be used **(Header key should be 'Authentication' and value should start with Bearer followed with a single blank space and recieved JWT)**

```
Authentication : Bearer <JWT>
```

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

### Authentication Flow

Plutocracy uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure authentication:

1. Register a new account or log in with existing credentials
2. Upon successful login, you'll receive a JWT token
3. This token must be included in the header of subsequent API requests:
   ```
   Authentication: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
   ```

> üîê **Sample JWT**: 
> ```
> eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJoYXJkaWsuYmVobDc0NDRAZ21haWwuY29tIiwiYWNjb3VudF9jcmVhdGlvbl90aW1lc3RhbXAiOiIyMDIxLTA1LTIyVDExOjIyOjE5LjQ5MTQ4NiIsInVzZXJfaWQiOiIzODQ3ZjYxYy1hNjc0LTQ0N2UtYmQ0ZC0wZThhODk3NTg2YmQiLCJ0b3RhbF9iYWxhbmNlX2lkIjoiMWQyZWNiMzctMDNkNS00YjhhLWI0Y2MtMDllZTBmYjQwMDM3Iiwic2NvcGUiOiJ1c2VyIiwibmFtZSI6IkhhcmRpayBCZWhsIiwiZXhwIjoxNjIxNzA4NDE0LCJpYXQiOjE2MjE2NzI0MTR9.XaqcTVYUuBIBtp74pJK-_mTtQCYMWdduoWGoYhsSxD4
> ```
> You can decode this at [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) to see the information it contains.
